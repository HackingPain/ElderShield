# SeniorCare Hub Testing Results

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke `deep_testing_frontend_v2` without explicit user permission
- When making backend code changes, always use `deep_testing_backend_v2` to test changes
- After frontend code updates, MUST stop to ask whether to test frontend or not using `ask_human` tool

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always read existing test results before making changes
- Follow testing protocol strictly
- Take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file
- NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by testing agents
