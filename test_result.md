# SeniorCare Hub Testing Results

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke `deep_testing_frontend_v2` without explicit user permission
- When making backend code changes, always use `deep_testing_backend_v2` to test changes
- After frontend code updates, MUST stop to ask whether to test frontend or not using `ask_human` tool

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always read existing test results before making changes
- Follow testing protocol strictly
- Take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file
- NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by testing agents

## Current Status: INITIAL SETUP

### Issues Identified
1. **Backend Configuration Mismatch**: Supervisor expects Python FastAPI in `/app/backend` but actual backend is Node.js Express in `/app/server`
2. **Frontend Path Mismatch**: Supervisor expects frontend in `/app/frontend` but actual frontend is in `/app/client`
3. **Database Mismatch**: Backend configured for PostgreSQL but system has MongoDB running
4. **Environment Variables**: Frontend using hardcoded URLs instead of REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
5. **Frontend Dependencies**: Need to resolve and test React app startup

### Next Steps
1. Fix supervisor configuration to point to correct directories
2. Update backend to use MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL
3. Fix frontend environment variables
4. Test backend functionality
5. Test frontend functionality (with user permission)

## Test History
- **Initial Assessment**: Identified configuration mismatches between supervisor, backend, and frontend setups
