# SeniorCare Hub Testing Results

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke `deep_testing_frontend_v2` without explicit user permission
- When making backend code changes, always use `deep_testing_backend_v2` to test changes
- After frontend code updates, MUST stop to ask whether to test frontend or not using `ask_human` tool

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always read existing test results before making changes
- Follow testing protocol strictly
- Take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file
- NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by testing agents

## Current Status: CONFIGURATION FIXES COMPLETED

### Issues Identified & RESOLVED
1. ✅ **Backend Configuration Mismatch**: Fixed supervisor to point to correct Node.js backend in `/app/server`
2. ✅ **Frontend Path Mismatch**: Fixed supervisor to point to correct React frontend in `/app/client`
3. ✅ **Database Configuration**: Updated backend to use MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL
4. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Updated frontend to use REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL correctly
5. ✅ **Frontend Dependencies**: Resolved React app dependencies using yarn

### Configuration Changes Made
- Updated `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf` to use correct directories and commands
- Modified `/app/client/.env` to use REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001/api
- Updated `/app/.env` to use MONGO_URL and PORT=8001 
- Converted database layer from PostgreSQL to MongoDB
- Made Redis and Firebase optional to avoid startup failures
- Updated package.json to include MongoDB driver

### Current Status
- ✅ MongoDB: Running and tested
- ✅ Frontend: Running on port 3000 
- ⚠️ Backend: Configuration updated, ready for testing
- ✅ Services: All supervisor services running

### Next Steps  
1. **PRIORITY**: Test backend functionality with deep_testing_backend_v2
2. Complete frontend integration testing (with user permission)
3. Continue with kiosk-style tablet deployment

## Test History
- **Initial Assessment**: Identified configuration mismatches between supervisor, backend, and frontend setups
- **Configuration Phase**: Fixed all major configuration issues and updated to use MongoDB
- **Basic Testing**: Verified MongoDB connection and Express server functionality
